## A Simple Basic Skeleton To Start a JavaFX Project

This is a minimal implementation of a project structure to get a complete, working JavaFX application up and running.  
The idea is to show how an MVC/MVCI structure can be implemented quickly to build custom GUI components which can be
repeatedly
used inside another layout component, such as FlowPane.

There is a dummy API to represent an external database, or booking application, and the screen loads via a background
thread - responding
when the data has been retrieved.

## How To Use This Project

Download the project and open it in your IDE, which should then detect the Gradle structure and begin setting up the
project components. When this is completed, go to the Gradle menu and, under "Build", select "Build". This should
download any necessary libraries and complete successfully.

Then, from the Gradle menu, under "Application", select "Run". This should run the application and you should see the
following:
